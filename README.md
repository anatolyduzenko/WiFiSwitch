# WiFi Switch â€“ ESP8266 Module âœ¨

This README outlines the details of the WiFi Switch project, a simple and efficient way to control devices over WiFi using the ESP8266 module.

## Introduction

The WiFi Switch is a smart project based on the ESP8266 module. It allows you to control any electrical device via WiFi, providing convenience, automation, and a step towards making your home smarter.
The initial project is based on the following article(russian) - https://habr.com/ru/articles/393497/

## Features

- Remote Control: Turn devices ON/OFF from anywhere on your local network.
- Simple Setup: Easy-to-configure firmware and hardware.
- Low Power Consumption: Efficient operation suitable for long-term use.
- Customizable: Modify the firmware to add new features or integrate with existing systems.

## Components

- ESP8266 Module: The core of the project.
- Relay Module: For switching devices.
- Power Supply: 5V/1A adapter to power the ESP8266.
- Wires: To connect everything together.

## Installation

1. Assemble the Circuit

    Connect the ESP8266 to the relay module.

    Wire the relay to the device you want to control.

    Ensure proper power connections.

2. Flash Firmware

    Download the firmware from this repository.

    Use a USB-to-Serial adapter to upload the firmware to the ESP8266.

3. Configure WiFi (in progress)

    Connect to the ESP8266's default access point.

    Open the configuration page (usually 192.168.4.1).

    Enter your WiFi credentials.

4. Test the Switch

    Open the control interface via your browser.

    Send ON/OFF commands to test the relay.

    How It Works

    The ESP8266 module connects to your local WiFi network.

    A web-based interface lets you send commands to the module.

    The ESP8266 triggers the relay, which controls the connected device.

## Tech Stack

- Microcontroller: ESP8266
- Programming Language: C++ (Arduino Framework)
- Communication Protocol: HTTP (GET/POST requests)

## Applications

- Home Automation: Control lights, fans, or other appliances.
- IoT Projects: Integrate with larger smart home systems.
- Learning Tool: Great for understanding IoT fundamentals.

## Future Enhancements

Add support for MQTT protocol.

Build a mobile app for easier control.

Integrate voice commands using Alexa or Google Assistant.

## Troubleshooting

ESP8266 Not Connecting to WiFi: Double-check your SSID and password.

Relay Not Working: Verify wiring and check for loose connections.

Firmware Issues: Ensure you're using the correct firmware for your ESP8266 version.
